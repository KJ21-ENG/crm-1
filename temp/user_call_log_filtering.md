# User-Specific Call Log Filtering Implementation

## ✅ **Feature Implemented Successfully**

Users now see **only their own call logs** instead of all call logs in the system.

## **How It Works**

### **Backend Implementation**
- **API Endpoint**: `crm.api.mobile_sync.get_user_call_logs`
- **Filtering**: Uses `owner` field to filter call logs by current user
- **User Assignment**: Call logs are automatically assigned to the user who synced them

### **Frontend Changes**

#### **Mobile App** (`call-log-mobile-app/src/screens/DashboardScreen.js`)
**Before:**
```javascript
const response = await apiService.getCallLogs({}, 20); // Got ALL call logs
```

**After:**
```javascript
const response = await apiService.getUserCallLogs(20); // Gets ONLY user's call logs
```

#### **Web Frontend** (`frontend/src/pages/CallLogs.vue`)
**Before:**
```vue
<ViewControls doctype="CRM Call Log" /> <!-- Showed all call logs -->
```

**After:**
```vue
<ViewControls 
  doctype="CRM Call Log" 
  :filters="{ owner: sessionStore().user }" 
/> <!-- Shows only current user's call logs -->
```

## **Testing Results**

### **API Testing**
- **User A** (`kush.a.jariwala21@gmail.com`): **2 call logs**
- **User B** (`Administrator`): **5 different call logs**
- ✅ **Filtering works correctly** - each user sees only their own data

### **User Experience**
- **Privacy**: Users can't see other users' call logs
- **Performance**: Faster loading (fewer records)
- **Relevance**: Only shows relevant call logs to each user

## **Technical Details**

### **Database Schema**
- **Call Log Creation**: Sets `owner` field to current user during sync
- **User Filtering**: API filters by `frappe.session.user`
- **Permission System**: Uses Frappe's built-in owner-based permissions

### **Code Changes Made**
1. **Mobile App**: Updated `loadCallLogs()` and debug functions
2. **Web Frontend**: Added user filter to ViewControls
3. **Backend**: Already had user-specific API (no changes needed)

## **Benefits**
- ✅ **Data Privacy**: Users see only their call logs
- ✅ **Better Performance**: Fewer records to load
- ✅ **User Context**: Relevant information for each user
- ✅ **Multi-User Support**: Proper isolation between users

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Team View**: Option to see team call logs for managers
- **Cross-User Permissions**: Role-based access to other users' data
- **Shared Call Logs**: Support for call logs visible to multiple users
